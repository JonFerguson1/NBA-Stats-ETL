ETL for extracting NBA team and player stats to store in MySQL database

- In order for the code to work MySQL database is needed. 
- The program will generate the database and tables if needed. 
- Since Python Selenium is used download a webdriver for your browser and set path in the extract function. 
- Create an empty log file "NBA_ETL_logfile.txt". 
- For your database.py file make sure to input your database connection info. 
- Double check the links to make sure the correct NBA season needs to be updated. As upload date is during the 2021-2022 season.
